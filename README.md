### Before Coding Dojo

1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
2. Create a skeleton for tic-tac-toe app:

    - `npm install -g create-react-app`
    - `create-react-app tic-tac-toe`
    - `cd tic-tac-toe`
    - `yarn start`
    - Delete all files in the `src/` folder
    - Add a file named `index.css` in the `src/` folder with [this CSS code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0100)
    - Add a file named `index.js` in the `src/` folder with [this JS code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010), and then add three lines to the top of it:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import './index.css';
    ```
